# Bac Ã  sable (sandpit) of :game_die: Monte Carlo :game_die:

Here we implement and test some Monte Carlo methods for fun. Some of them for educational purposes, some of them for research purposes.
Mainly implemented in `Julia` and when available compared with existing libraries in `Python`.

Currently being implemented and tested:
- [ ] Ensemble Slice Sampler by Karamanis et al. (2020) [Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06212) [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03468) see codes [zeus](https://github.com/minaskar/zeus) and [numpyro](https://num.pyro.ai/en/latest/mcmc.html#numpyro.infer.ensemble.ESS).

Some I want to implement one day:
- [ ] Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
- [ ] No-U-Turn Sampler
- [ ] Nested Sampling
